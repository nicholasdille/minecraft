# invites are either temporary or "permanent" (a better word would
# be persistent, since permanent invites can expire)
#
# Temporary invites require the other player be online and it
# will send them a message with a timeout to accept.
#
# Permanent invites can be either forever or have an expiry time.
# These can be sent even if players are offline. In addition, if
# you send an invite to "public", the invite is available to everyone.

  # 0 would be a forever invite
  # a string is also accepted such as "5m" for 5 minutes, or

  # time string.
