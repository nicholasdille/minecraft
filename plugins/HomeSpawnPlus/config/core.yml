  #     Will store one file per data type (home, spawn, etc).
  # YAML_SINGLE_FILE - YAML storage in your plugins/HomeSpawnPlus
  #     directory. Stores all data in single "data.yml" file.
  # PERSISTANCE_REIMPLEMENTED_EBEANS - use persitance reimplemented

  #     a few extra benefits. http://goo.gl/rtdDH  To live-reload
  #     with this, due to a Bukkit limitation, you must edit

  # This is one option that cannot be reloaded live with "/hsp rc",
  # you must restart Bukkit if you change this option.

  # Warn on any known plugin conflicts that might prevent HSP from

  warnConflicts: true

  # HSP includes defaults for all config items in these config

  # If true, HSP will require 2 clicks on the bed to set the home. This
  # avoids accidentally setting your bedhome when you don't mean to.

  # If true, HSP will require it be night time in order for a bed home
  # to be saved by clicking on it. (ie. single player mechanics)
  bedHomeMustBeNight: false

  # If set to true, the player will never see the "You can only
  # sleep at night" message. Be warned this has the unfortunate side
  # effect that they can't sleep in the bed either, although they
  # can get around this by shift-clicking (sneak) the bed instead.
  bedHomeNeverDisplayNightMessage: false

  # This restores the "original" behavior where all bed clicks go
  # through (instead of supressing the first in 2click mode), which
  # makes it possible to night sleep on first click and set home on
  # 2 clicks. Note this is also possible without this option by
  # the player using sneak to sleep vs. set home.

  # if recordLastLogout is true, HSP will record the precise location

  # Event priority; the basic assumption is that you want HSP to

  # for some reason.

  # HSP has a notion of "default home" which the player can change
  # by using /setdefaulthome. In the event that the player has

  #   BUKKIT: use Bukkit Player.hasPlayedBefore() method

  #   ORIGINAL: use HSP's original algorithm, which first checks
  #     HSP's database for any record, then falls back to a
  #     PLAYER_DAT check. This can be faster since it's a cached
  #     DB lookup instead of a file access, but it also means that
  #     you can't test "new player" strategies simply by removing
  #     the player.dat file.

  # If enabled, "safe teleport" will be used for any teleport

  # instead.

  # dying in world_nether will spawn you at your home in "world".
